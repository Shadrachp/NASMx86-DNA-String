# NASMx86-DNA-String
## Introduction:
 - The DNA in our human body is composed of 4 nucleobases (i.e., the alphabet of DNA).
  These are adenine(A), cytosine(C), guanine(G) and thymine(T). Thus, we can view our DNA as a
  string composed of the “alphabets” A,C,G and T. In computational biology, two of the basic
  tasks are to determine the number of A,C,G and T in a given DNA string and to take the reverse
  complement of a DNA string.

 - In DNA strings, “A” and “T” are complements of each other, as are “C” and “G”.
  The reverse complement of a DNA string is formed by reversing the DNA string and then
  taking the complement of each alphabet. Thus the reverse complement of “GTCA” is “TGAC”.
## Objective:
  - Write a working x86-32 assembly language to determine the length of a DNA string, the
  frequency count of the symbol “A”,”C”,”G” and “T” and the reverse complement of the DNA
  string.
## Given: 
  - A DNA string of length at most of 255 DNA alphabets terminated.
  Output: a.) string length; b.) frequency of “A”; c.) frequency of “C”; d.) frequency of “G”; e.)
  frequency of “T”; f.) Reverse complement of the DNA String. Don’t forget to check for null input
  and invalid input.
